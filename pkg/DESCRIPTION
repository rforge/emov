Description: During perception, the eye moves
 to scan the visual field. Such movements consist
 of alternating saccades and fixations. Eye-movement
 analysis is performed in many fields of research,
 e.g. sports, virtual reality, marketing, usability,
 psychology and medical research. This package
 provides eye movement analysis algorithms for saccade
 and fixation detection.
